# WurmTools.Desktop

**WurmTools.Desktop** is an open-source, offline-first desktop toolkit for *Wurm Online* players.  
It focuses on performance, transparency, modular design, and experimental development.

This project is also an experiment:

> **How far can a real-world desktop tool go using AI-assisted development, combined with human domain knowledge and curation?**

## Project Philosophy

This project follows a **human-in-the-loop** approach.

### Human-driven
- Concept and overall direction
- Architectural decisions
- Dataset curation, validation, and structure
- Review, testing, and final acceptance

### AI-assisted
- Code generation and iteration
- Refactoring and optimization suggestions
- Boilerplate and repetitive implementation work

This is **not** a “pure AI-generated project”, nor a one-click result.  
AI is used as a tool — **not as an authority**.

## Why This Exists

Wurm Online contains a vast amount of information:
- items
- crafting chains
- skills
- materials
- mechanics

Many existing tools are:
- web-only
- slow
- fragmented
- difficult to maintain

**WurmTools.Desktop** aims to be:
- ⚡ Fast (local, offline-first)
- 🧩 Modular and extensible
- 🔍 Inspectable and transparent
- 🛠️ Built for real players, not just theory

---

## Scope & Current Status

🚧 **Early-stage / experimental**

Current goals:
- Desktop application (Windows / Linux / macOS)
- Local data processing (no required backend)
- Modular architecture for future tools

Planned modules include:
- Item database viewer
- Advanced search and filtering
- Crafting and dependency helpers
- Log and chat analysis (privacy-friendly)
- Data inspection and export tools

---

## Open Source & Transparency

This repository is **open source by design**.

- The **codebase** is open to inspect, learn from, and contribute to.
- The **dataset** is curated with significant human effort.
- Some datasets may be released gradually or separately.

This is intentional.

Open source does **not** mean zero effort or zero ownership —  
it means **shared improvement with respect for the work involved**.

## Dataset Notice

The dataset used by WurmTools.Desktop is:
- curated and structured by a human
- validated against in-game behavior
- partially derived from publicly available community sources (such as Wurmpedia)

Please respect the dataset license and attribution requirements.  
Do **not** redistribute or repackage datasets without permission.

## Licensing

- **Code**: see `LICENSE`
- **Dataset**: see `DATASET_LICENSE`

Different components of this project may use different licenses.  
This separation is intentional and documented.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome — including AI-assisted contributions.

Guidelines:
- Be transparent when AI tools are used
- Keep changes understandable and reviewable
- Respect the project’s goals and experimental nature

## Final Note

This project exists out of curiosity.

If you learn something from it, improve it, or build something inspired by it —  
that alone already makes it a success.
